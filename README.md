# youtube-video-summarizer

Currently just downloads the video transcript of a youtube video and summarizes it with claude but I want to get frames and use instructblip to summarize them for parts that a text only transcript is ambigous

Here's some example output from https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v\=ZHmHBMaS6Sw

Here is a summary of the video transcript:

- Developing a controlled fusion reactor is challenging and requires solving complex plasma physics and engineering problems.
- A fusion reactor needs to maintain an ultra-high vacuum, inject fuel,separate out helium ash and handle the high energy neutrons produced.
- The neutrons cause damage to the reactor materials through transmutation, activation and displacement of atoms in the lattice. They also produce a lot of heat that must be extracted.
- Tritium breeding is essential for a self-sustaining reactor but has not yet been demonstrated.
-  Rare and valuable materials may be depleted over time and their usage must be optimized.
- Fusion reactors could enable fundamental materials science experiments and applications like nuclear waste transmutation or valuable element production.

The sections that could benefit from visual descriptions are:

Here is a summary of the video:

- Developing a controlled and economically viable fusion reactor is challenging. It requires producing a lot of energy, maintaining a vacuum, injecting fuel, and separating out helium ash.

- Most of the energy comes out as neutrons, which can only be absorbed as heat. This heat is used to drive turbines to generate electricity.

- Neutrons cause damage in several ways:

1. Transmutation: Nuclei change from one element to another.
2. Activation: Nuclei become radioactive.
3. Displacement: Atoms are displaced within solids, damaging materials. Exposure to plasma also causes damage.

- Fusion reactors must breed enough tritium to be self-sufficient. This is an unsolved challenge.
